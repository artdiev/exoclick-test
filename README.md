### Features

### Bugs and issues
- No props validation or tests are provided -easy fix
- Logic and presentation are mixed up together a little -easy fix
- Due to caching load more breaks when going back to already visited repositories. Needs to be
 fixed by using Apollo in-memory store instead of useState hook for pages.
- GH Graphql does not have a query to get contributors. Rest is used instead.
- ESLint issues
